                        KLOA is a startup that focuses on making search easier by saving users typing effort. This new
                        search experience consists of an input interface and a contextual search algorithm (see
                        <a href="#userFlow" class="link-bordered">this</a>
                        section
                        for interaction map). Ideally, businesses with mobile shopping apps like Amazon or Instacart
                        would
                        be potential clients of KLOA.

                        including what types of feedback to provide users. This research then seeks to understand:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>

                            How willing participants would be to learn how to use KLOA? How would they prefer to learn
                            about it?
                        </li>

                    </ul>

                    <p>KLOA is aware of usability issues and are actively iterating on the design. So our study focused
                        on two hypotheses:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <div class="bold">Hypothesis 1 </div><br>

                            If users don't think of KLOA as a keyboard, they won't try to use it like a QWERTY keyboard
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <div class="bold">Hypothesis 2 </div><br>

                            Users will be able to use KLOA if onboarding instructions are provided (a variation of
                            "best

                            and
                            re-doing tasks. 4 out of 5 participants mentioned frustration about not receiving typing
                            feedback (by typing feedback, we are referring to seeing “a” in the search input field
                            after
                            tapping on the key). They struggled while typing because only search suggestions were
                            visible.
                            One participant tried to type the letter ‘b’ but kept getting results starting with ‘c’.
                            The
                            participant tried to long press, double tap, and go into all caps mode, then proceeded
                            to
                            restart the query by deleting input six times.</p>

                    <h3>What I learned</h3>
                    <p>It was challenging working with a prototype that wasn't fully functional. The NLP algorithm
                        wasn't completely predictable (although it worked for a few words we chose), and the company was
                        actively going through redesign and testing with
                        users at the same time we were conducting our own tests. Even though it wasn't ideal that there
                        was tape on the prototype, I still believe that choosing to test with the tape did not
                        significantly affect the results of our research, and we still obtained valuable insights tthat
                        were actionable for the company.
                    </p>

                    <p>If I had more time for this project, I would have suggested Rapid Iterative Testing and
                        Evaluation (RITE) with figma designs to avoid any complications in research results that were
                        caused by
                        the algorithm not working properly. Because the product is very early stage, it would be more
                        ideal to adopt this kind of method in order to test more versions of the design which is more
                        important for this kind of product in order to understand mental models around keyboards
                        more deeply.
                    </p>

                    <p>The research we conducted has shown opportunities for the company to explore - how much
                        information is needed by users to learn this kind of layout, and what kind of medium would be
                        the most universally understandable to communicate this information? How much information needs
                        to be provided for onboarding in order for users to feel confident about using the keyboard? We
                        chose to use a one-pager that was very minimal in text and images just to get a gauge of where
                        the users are at with learning a new layout for search purposes, and to inform future onboarding
                        materials in the future.</p>

                    <p>All in all, it was a great learning experience and I learned a lot about usability testing with
                        our mixed method approach. This kind of usability testing is more similar to what would happen
                        in the real world, with a prototype that is constantly being updated, that may not be production
                        ready yet. </p>
