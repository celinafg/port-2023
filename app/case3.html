                <p class="description right">In the last few years, the video format is gaining popularity on all
                    platforms. Not just on platforms like YouTube and Vimeo which are primarily meant for video
                    streaming, but also on social media apps like Instagram and LinkedIn.

                    <br><br>

                    For our 516 class, we conducted a 2x2 factorial experiment exploring how the presence of people and
                    text affected clicks across categories.

                    <h3>Increasing points of engagement for content creators
                    </h3>
                    <p>Our study examined how the presence of people or text in thumbnails affects click-through rates
                        across different video categories on YouTube. We analyzed over 10,000 thumbnails and found that
                        the presence of people in thumbnails significantly increased click-through rates across all
                        categories except for gaming. The effect of people in thumbnails varied by category, with food
                        and beauty videos seeing the most significant increase in click-through rates. Our findings have
                        important implications for video creators and marketers looking to optimize their thumbnails to
                        attract more viewers. Further research on thumbnail content and its impact on click-through
                        rates is needed as video content continues to grow in popularity.

                    <p>Our biggest area of interest were users in the age group 18-34 which is YouTube's largest
                        audience. We also controlled by using frequency of use, and device used for watching YouTube. We
                        controlled for these in order to ensure that we were getting participants that were familiar
                        with the interface and knew how to use the 'categories' portion which we concentrated on.
                        Content categories were chosen before hand by doing some secondary research, and convenience
                        sampling was used in because of the limited amount of time and resources we had for this
                        project. </p>

                    <h3>Experiment Design</h3>
                    <p>For our study, we decided to go with a within-subjects because due to the
                        contstraints of time and resources, it required less participants and minimizes random noise.
                        <br><br>
                        We controlled variables such as quality of thumbnail used, view counts, and length of video.
                    </p>
                    <p>2x2 factorial design allowed us to understand the effects of two independent variables (each with
                        two levels) on a single dependent variable.</p>

                        category. Participants went through a screener, then continued on to the test if they qualified.

                    <h3>Why Conditional Logistic Regression?</h3>
                    <p>We decided to use Conditional Logistic Regression to help us analyze two controlled variables and
                        perform stratifying the data bewteen multiple screens. It reduces any sparse data bias that may
                        ovvur when there are several predictor values. We also analyzed the interaction effect between
                        text and people. <br><br>
                        We chose not to use ANOVA because it assumes that the data in each category is normally
                        distributed, and because it is not optimal for analyzing ordinal data. Logistic regression makes
                        generalizations based on simple data so it was more relevant for our analysis and our goal of
                        providing recommendations for different video categories on YouTube.

                    <p> Thumbnails with text have 5.24 times better odds of being selected than thumbnails without
                        text (p - 1.39e-11). Thumbnails with people have 3.30 times better odds of being selected than
                        thumbnails without
                        people (p = 2.67e-06). There was a negative interaction when there were both text and people
                        present. Odds of
                        selection were reduced by 0.5 times (p = 0.0262).<br><br>
                        Based on the top 3 thumbnails selected, we can see that the text is prominently displayed in the
                        thumbnail with everything else being an accompanying visual which may also explain how
                        thumbnails with text have better odds of being selected and that the interaction of text and
                        people may not matter.

                        was a negative interaction, where the presence of both text and people reduced the odds of

                        times better odds of being selected than thumbnails without people (p = 6.93e-09). The presence
                        of both text and people increased the odds of selection by 2.45 times (p = 0.000798).

                        <br><br>
                        For tutorials, we focused on food-related tutorials and looking at the top 3 thumbnails
                        selected, it was interesting to notes that they did not include any people, despite a
                        statistically significant odds of being selected. Next, when we looked at the reason for
                        selection, participants stated that is was important to identify the images on the thumbnail
                        (top no. of counts).

                        Therefore, Having people has 0.317 better odds than not having people and Have both text and

                    <p> As with any other experiment, there are limitations. For future studies, we recommend that
                        participants be screened based on their top 2 devices for watching YouTube. Half of our
                        responses were screened out since they watched more on there smartphone. The study is limited to
                        only two age groups. It would be interesting to study the patters of other age groups as well
                        which could be helpful in guiding platform design. Since we are not experts and not working with
                        Youtube, we recognize that we have limited knowledge of confounding variables that could affect
                        the study. <br><br>
                        Our study has low external validity because we chose the thumbnails, and google forms does not
                        closely mimic natural browsing behavior, as well as forcing a selection to be made. It has a
                        high internal validity because we control the selection of thumbnails and what order they are in
                        the screen.

                                <h4>Cleaning data is HARD WORK!</h4>
                                <p>I started learning python this quarter for another class, and decided to stick to the
                                    language (vs. R) for this quant class. Because we didn't have resources to use MTurk
                                    or Qualtrics, we had to clean the google form data and explode the participant rows
                                    to 72 per person in order to run the regression properly. <br><br>
                                    As the only one with coding knowledge, I took it upon myself to figure out how to
                                    use pandas to clean and transform the data (else we were going to go in manually and
                                    do it ourselves - only 3k rows of data but still extremely laborious and prone to
                                    human errors) and it all worked out in the end. Cleaning the data was 80% of the
                                    work. Running the regression was done in a second. It was nice to see significant
                                    results. </p>

                                <p>When we first started out with designing our study, we agreed we wanted to tightly
                                    control our variables to avoid any issues with analysis. After this project I
                                    understood how there has to be a balance between how controlled a study is and how
                                    true to life it could be. Forcing a selection of thumbnails and mocking it up like
                                    we did does not mimic natural scrolling behavior. However, I do think we did our
                                    best with what resources we had. </p>

                                <p>I really enjoyed getting our data, having significant results and trying to analyze
                                    weird patters in behavior. We used a mixture of quantitative and qualititave
                                    questions in our survey which allowed us to have a richer analysis.</p>
