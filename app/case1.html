                    united
                    states,
                    Seattle’s own air
                    quality in October 2022 plunged to an unsettling AQI score of 168, ranking the worst in the world.
                    The
                    salience of this led us to focus on air quality designing under the prompt "how might we do life
                    together" for HCDE 518.
                    <br><br>

                    Our proposal is to create a more widespread public health alert system. We explored this solution
                    through the Air Quality System, that helps people find air quality information and masks where they
                    need
                    them.

                        outdoor gatherings when air quality is poor in Seattle? But due to our research findings, we

                        to pivot our focus to the more pressing issue of educating residents about air quality. </p>

                    <h4>1. Poor air is dangerous to the health of all Seattle residents regardless of sensitivity
                        label</h4>
                    <p>Drawing on the research of experts in the medical field, wildfire smoke is made up of
                        particulate matter (PM2.5) 2.5 which is small enough to be be inhaled deeply into the lungs.
                        As wildfires worsen, the need for health research around long-term effects continues. Recent
                        research has found that there may be a strong relationship between inhaling PM2.5
                        and reduced lung function, chronic bronchitis, pneumonia, asthma and COPD even in groups
                        that aren't under the 'sensitive' group label(Youssouf et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2015; Reid
                        et al., 2016a).</p>

                        knowledge
                        were concerning air quality. Almost all participants conducted outdoor activities at least
                        once
                        a week and mentioned they were likely to change their behavior if air was poor. Their most
                        trusted sources were weather apps, followed by news mentioned by a friend and lastly
                        government
                        sites. Most were familiar with the AQI rating system, and had varying thresholds of what air
                        quality they would consider safe to go outside in.</p>

                    <p>

                        Based on our findings from 9 interviews, we found that ​everyone had differing opinions and
                        behaviors when it ​came to air quality. From who they trusted as their source ​of
                        information, to deciding which occasions were safe ​enough to venture outside with a mask.
                        Many based their​decisions from a glance–either at the color of the AQI ​meter, the word
                        “unhealthy”, their weather app’s warning, ​or simply from looking outside. Their
                        understanding of the effects of poor air to their health both short and long term were
                        either wrong or severely underestimated.

                        would be more appropriate to addressing the bigger problem of lack of knowledge of the harmful

                        wearing masks and staying indoors, but in the same week, they would compromise and flip to an
                        Impressionable mindset when they wanted to attend an event outdoors.

                        public health design . We ​chose to create a system instead of a single solution in ​order to
                        increase the chances of residents to encounter ​information about air quality. We devised a
                        system that ​includes: <br></p>
                    <ul class="">
                        <li>Air Quality Station</li>
                        <li>Text alert system</li>
                        <li>Website for centralized information</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><br>
                        Having multiple reminders about air quality ​will spark interest in being more informed about
                        bad air ​conditions.

                            regardless of how our ideas manifested, our underlying proposal is that knowledge about
                            unhealthy air and how to mitigate its effects is a matter of public health that needs to be

                    <p>Instead of testing the entire system, we decided to focus ​on one of the more complex
                        interactions
                        that we were ​trying to make, which was how a user approaches the air ​station and obtains a
                        mask.
                        We tested the SMS texting ​system with a real number during user testing.

                        scheme based on ​our research and usability testing. Because some people ​relied on visual /
                        empirical evidence of air quality, it was ​important that just glancing at the visualization
                        will
                        tell the ​user what level it is. The visualizations went through user ​testing, and they are
                        understandable regardless of whether ​you are color blind or not. The final spec document also
                        includes some infrastructure specification like street clearance, height of keypad, to be in
                        accordance with building code and accessibility code.
